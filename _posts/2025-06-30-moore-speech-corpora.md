Working with under-resourced languages like Moor√© is both exciting and challenging. In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through the full pipeline I used to collect and prepare Moor√© speech data scraped from the Bible-ready to be pushed to the Hugging Face Hub.

---

### 1. Environment Setup

Let‚Äôs kick things off by setting up the Python environment.

Create a new virtual env with preferably Python 3.10.11:

```bash
conda create -n mooredata python=3.10.11
conda activate mooredata
````

Also, I recommend downgrading pip to 24.0 (or below):

```bash
pip install --upgrade "pip<24.1"
```

You may be asking yourself why these specific constraints from the beginning. Well, I've got many errors while trying to work on this using Python 3.12.0 and 3.11.13. The raised error was:

```bash
ValueError: mutable default <class 'fairseq.dataclass.configs.CommonConfig'>
for field common is not allowed: use default_factory
```

After quite a lot of investigations, I found out that the `ValueError` occurs when using Fairseq v0.12.2 with Python 3.11 or 3.12 due to its use of mutable dataclass defaults, which are disallowed in these Python versions. That‚Äôs why, to fix this, I downgraded to Python **3.10 and pip <24.1**.

> Trust me, just make sure to do the same to not waste a lot of time resolving package conflicts like me.

### 2. Install Audio & Text Processing Dependencies

Next, let‚Äôs ensure you have all required system-level packages.

Update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
```

Normally you should already have the necessary environment-level packages:

* for audio processing: `libsox-fmt-all`, `sox`, and `ffmpeg`
* for text processing and Unicode symbols: `libicu-dev` and `pkg-config`

If not, install them:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-all sox ffmpeg
sudo apt install libicu-dev pkg-config
```

---

### 3. Install Torch (Nightly Version)

Now it's time to install PyTorch. Make sure to get the **nightly version** from the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

If you have a Nvidia GPU, select the CUDA version. Otherwise, stick with CPU.

![Torch Install](/assets/img/img_moore_speech_corpora/torch_install.png){: width="500" height="300" }

For me, the command was:

```bash
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
```

Then install additional packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Clone Required Repos

We‚Äôll need two external repositories to proceed.

#### Fairseq

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq.git
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./ 
cd ..
```

#### Uroman

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isi-nlp/uroman.git
```

Make these changes to match what Fairseq expects:

```bash
mkdir -p uroman/bin && mv uroman/uroman/uroman.pl uroman/bin/uroman.pl && mv uroman/uroman/data uroman/data
```

Your folder structure should now look like:

```bash
moore-data-scraping-bible/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fairseq/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uroman/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uroman.pl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other folders)
```

---

### 5. Scraping Bible Data

With everything in place, let‚Äôs scrape the Moor√© Bible data.

Execute:

```bash
sh ./crawlers/bible/crawl.sh
```

If you run into this error:

```
ImportError: /home/anyantudre/miniconda3/envs/mooredata/bin/../lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicuuc.so.74)
```

Fix it with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gcc=12.1.0
```

![Crawling Process](/assets/img/img_moore_speech_corpora/crawling_process.png){: width="1000" height="150" }

### 6. Resampling

Now let‚Äôs resample the scraped audio files to 16kHz.

Run:

```bash
bash preprocessing/resample.sh --input_folder datasets/moore/bible/raw --output_folder datasets/moore/bible/resampled
```

If the script fails due to formatting, convert it to Unix-style line endings:

```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix
dos2unix resample.sh
```

---

### 7. Forced Alignment

This is a crucial step: segmenting long audio clips into short, clean utterances.

We‚Äôll use the **MMS Forced Aligner**. You can check if your language is supported [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mms/tts/all-tts-languages.html). For Moor√©, the model code is `mos`.

Run the alignment script:

```bash
bash forced_alignement/align_and_segment.sh \
  --audio_folder datasets/moore/bible/resampled \
  --text_folder datasets/moore/bible/resampled \
  --output_folder datasets/moore/bible/aligned \
  --lang mos \
  --uroman_path ../uroman/bin
```

> On an Nvidia RTX 4070 (8GB), this took \~5 hours.

---

### 8. Export to Hugging Face Format

Last step!

Log in to your Hugging Face account:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Then push your dataset:

```bash
python data_export/prepare_hf_dataset.py \
  --input_folder datasets/moore/bible/aligned \
  --repo_id anyantudre/moore-speech-bible \
  --hf_token hf_xxxx
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: By default, datasets pushed to the Hub are public. You can update this later from your Hugging Face dashboard.

---

That‚Äôs it! üéâ You now have a fully processed, aligned, and ready-to-train Moor√© speech dataset, directly from Bible text and audio. Hope this helps you save some setup time and avoid the many little snags I ran into.

Feel free to fork the repo, tweak things for your own language, and contribute improvements.
